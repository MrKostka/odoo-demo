# GB Case study
First, I would like to mention that it was quite interesting for me to work with this framework. I had no experience with Odoo before and the ERP system too, so I felt a little bit lost in the whole complex workspace, but at least I tried some stuff, and I hope some of it was working. 

I opened this repository for public use because I don't know who I should give access to for sharing. My whole work is in the hr_custom addon. 

1. task - I tried to use hr addon, but emails were over me, so I finished it with an unclear end. 
2. task - looks simple; I added a few lines of code, but I feel some hidden secrets behind that. 
3. task - not for me; I had quite a problem with multiple addons and looking for certain models between them, so this one—recruitment and job application forms—was far ahead of my knowledge. I understand maybe just a little of what was expected—to put some meaningful guides for every input field—but I do not know how to do it there. 
4. task - I tried to create a controller, and the GET mock method works fine, but obviously I had some issues with authentication when I tried to send a POST request from Postman. I looked at token retrieval at /web/session/authenticate, but I was not able to get any.
